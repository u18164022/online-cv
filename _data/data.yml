      details: |
        I am an ambitious student who initially had very little knowledge on the subject of programming, development 
        and Computer Science but who took to it very quickly. Since I have started my degree, I have learnt how to use many
        languages efficiently and also have an understanding of the logic and underlying systems allowing me to
        come up with my own ideas and work. So far I have seen great success at university and strive to continue this progress 
        so that I do not limit my options in the future.
